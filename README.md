# MulS
This project that aims to provide multiplatform tool for obtain hashes of files and strings with as much algorythms as possible. The software is distributed under the BSD 3 Clause License. The download is on workupload because I'm poor for paying a webhost and I'm lazy, I don't want to make a webserver on my vps :P

# First Release
The first release of the software is not compiled and is located mainly in the experimental branch and not in the master branch. I merged the two branches for making more easy for people to find the source code. Remember that the experimental branch will get a lot of updates comparing to master that will only have stable releases inside.
This release cannot hash files, only strings.

# Hashing Algorythms
In the version 0.77-Alpha you have only SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 avaialable for hashing... MD5 and other algorythms will be added in future releases.

# Support notice
If I will add new features in the experimental branch, you will encounter bugs maybe... if you do please make a pull request with the bug fixed or just report the bug!
